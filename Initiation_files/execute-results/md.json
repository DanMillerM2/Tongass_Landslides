For example, is the initiation-zone width or area related to tangential curvature?\n\nUse program LS_poly.\n\n-   Filter the inventory to debris avalanches and debris flows.\n\n-   Using the \"flattenWatermask\" code from the DEM_module, generate center lines for each landslide polygon.\n\n-   Translate center lines to linked nodes.\n\n-   Build a \"closest-node\" raster within each polygon.\n\n-   Get mean, minimum, and maximum values of topographic indices associated with each node.\n\n-   Get average polygon width as area/center-line-length.\n\n-   Delineate an initiation zone with length equal to mean width.\n\nProgram LS_poly generates an output node point shapefile of centerlines. Each node has associated attributes for horizontal distance from the top of the polygon, upslope area, node-associated slope, tangential curvature, and what ever else we might want to examine, e.g., a modeled factor of safety. To delineate the likely (I hope) initiation zone, I took the area associated with nodes within the mean polygon width of the up-slope extent of each polygon. We can look at the distribution of topographic-index values for these initiation zones relative to the rest of the DEM. I'll filter the DEM to include only index values within the range included in the initiation zones.\n\nI'll start by looking at some rasters created with makegrids and LS_init. Grad_15.flt is centered-window gradient over a radius of 7.5m (diameter of 15m). Init.flt is a raster mask representing assumed initiation zones generated as described above using LS_init; it has value 1 within the initiation zone and nodata (-9999.) elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nGet the gradient within the initiation zones.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n            init\n           <num>\n    1: 2.0276802\n    2: 1.9772296\n    3: 1.8767934\n    4: 1.7534219\n    5: 1.5707017\n   ---          \n56149: 0.6181532\n56150: 0.5843589\n56151: 0.5613263\n56152: 0.5544583\n56153: 0.5748648\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe topography within these zones is determined using post-landslide lidar. Some portion of the zone may include head scarps with steeper gradients than the pre-landslide topography. Likewise, the initiating zone may be a subset of the mapped zone, since the boundary may expand either during or after failure. Given these factors, it seems appropriate to filter out the extreme low and high gradient values. I'll do this using Tukey's fences.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                grad_15\n                  <num>\n        1: 0.0016781257\n        2: 0.0014676113\n        3: 0.0008816146\n        4: 0.0009484029\n        5: 0.0025376051\n       ---             \n142287760: 0.0019852403\n142287761: 0.0032839631\n142287762: 0.0049797115\n142287763: 0.0068473923\n142287764: 0.0075887116\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nI want to exclude areas where landslides do not initiate from further analyses.

Next step: look for relationships between width of the entire polygon and topographic attributes. This will require improving alignment of the polygons. See the example below.\n\n![Mapped landslide polygon overlain on tangential curvature raster with shaded relief.](images/clipboard-3238418704.png)\n\nThe landslide polygon roughly aligns with the channel it most likely traversed, but measures of topographic indices obtained within the polygon will not accurately represent the topography traversed by the landslide. Can we align the centerline of the polygon with the center of the channel (or swale?) indicated by the topography? Not all polygons have an obvious offset like this, so it will be a bit challenging determining which polygons to reposition and precisely how to reposition them.\n\nWhat aspect of the topography should we examine? What length scales should we measure those topographic attributes over? I ran program ls_poly and output a csv file with polygon attributes.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Initiation_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   Min. 1st Qu.

So 30 m seems like an appropriate length scale. Using tangential curvature as a measure of confinement, we might therefore look for the maximum curvature within a polygon cross section as a measure of the topographic confinement associated with that landslide. Using the closest-node raster within each polygon and finding the maximum tangential curvature associated with each node, we find these relationships with mean polygon width and polygon length:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nI anticipated that smaller widths and longer lengths would be associated with larger maximum tangential curvatures. This is roughly true for length, but width does not appear to exhibit such a relationship. Nevertheless, the largest widths are associated with smaller maximum curvatures. Another option: apply a buffer around each polygon to account for the lack of precision and misalignment of the polygon boundaries. Create a nearest-node raster within the buffered polygon and get mean maximum curvature for the buffered polygon.\n",
