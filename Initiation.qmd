Efforts to anticipate the consequences of a landslide occurring commonly use three sequential phases of analysis:

1.  Susceptibility. Where landslides occur.

2.  Hazard. How often and how big.

3.  Risk. The consequences - costs - if a landslide occurs.

This study is focused on susceptibility. We examine susceptibility in three ways:

1.  Susceptibility to landslide initiation.

2.  Extent of landslide runout.

3.  Linking susceptibility to initiation with likely runout extent to determine susceptibility to landslides that initiate upslope. \

This section looks at methods for determining susceptibility to landslide initiation.
