    "text": "With previous analyses using the Tongass Landslide Inventory, I used a frequency-ratio approach for initiation and survival analysis for runout. I still like the frequency-ratio method, but want to compare it to other options. For Prince of Wales, I used a topographic index calculated as partial contributing area times slope. I’d like to try something different here, a semi-factor-of-safety, which I hope will combine topographic elements in a more physically relevant way to render a single-valued measure of landslide propensity. Derivation of a simple model is described in FoS.\nThe Tongass inventory consists of polygons delineating landslide scars mapped from aerial photographs. I want to use the entire polygon to extract topographic, soils, and land-cover attributes. I want to see if we can find relationships with initiation-zone size, inundation area, runout-zone width, and runout length with the underlying terrain attributes. A key component for obtaining these attributes is to create a centerline for each polygon consisting of a series of linked nodes. The nodes are initiated at DEM grid points, but the centerline path may be smoothed. Each node can then be assigned attributes of the polygon associated with the node position in the polygon, such as distance from the upslope end(s) and distance to the downslope end(s). Several rasters can be created for each polygon: distance to edge (which gives polygon width for nodes along the centerline), the frequency distribution of elevation, gradient, curvatures, contributing areas, land cover, and anything else of interest associated with the portion of the polygon closest to each node.\nAn important objective with this project is to provide a series of markdown notebooks that illustrate the methods and provide the code and data for replication of the analyses. This will enable others to check these results, to apply the methods to other sites, and to expand and improve those methods. I rely partly on programs that I have written in Fortran. The source code is licensed under GPLv3 and executable files can be provided (compiled for the Windows operating system). Much of the statistical modeling and image production is done using R."

    "text": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. http://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n                        Preamble\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nDefinitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others’ Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nUse with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n{project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands show w' andshow c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html."

Set what we cannot know constant.\nSee this article in the National Highschool Journal of Science for a nice description of the infinite slope model.\nWe define the Factor of Safety (FoS) as the ratio of forces acting to hold soil in place to those acting to move soil downslope. FoS values greater than one indicate stability, less than one indicate failure. For a cohesionless, constant-thickness, isotropic, uniform soil layer on an infinite slope with steady-state surface-parallel saturated subsurface flow, forces acting to hold soil in place are given by the effective normal stress \\(\\sigma_n'\\) at the base of the soil column (i.e., the soil-bedrock interface) multiplied by \\(\\tan\\phi\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the friction angle of the soil. The effective stress is given by the proportion of the weight of the soil column directed normal to the base of the soil layer minus the pore pressure at the base. For a soil layer of depth \\(z,\\) the weight of a unit length and width soil column is \\(\\gamma_s(z\\cos\\theta),\\) where \\(\\gamma_s\\) is the unit weight of soil (assumed spatially uniform) and \\(\\theta\\) is the slope of the base of the soil layer (measured from horizontal), which is assumed parallel to the ground surface (the soil layer has uniform thickness). The portion of that weight directed normal to the base of the soil layer is \\[\\sigma_n = \\gamma_s(z\\cos\\theta)\\cos\\theta.\\]\nFor a saturated zone of vertical depth \\(h\\) within the soil layer, with seepage directed parallel to the surface of the ground surface, the pore pressure \\(u\\) at the base of the soil layer is \\[u = \\gamma_w(h\\cos\\theta)\\cos\\theta.\\]\nThe effective stress at the base of the soil layer is \\(\\sigma_n' = \\sigma_n - u,\\) so the force acting to hold soil in place is: \\[Force\\;holding\\;soil\\;in\\;place = (\\sigma_n - u)\\tan\\phi = \\gamma_s z \\cos\\theta^2 - \\gamma_w h \\cos\\theta^2.\\]\nWe can determine the depth of saturation \\(h\\) based on the discharge through the soil column. That discharge is equal to the surface area of the flow tube exiting the soil column, measured normal to the direction of water flow, times the Darcy velocity of flow through that surface. The flow tube defined by flow exiting the column has width \\(b\\) as it flows out of the column, where \\(b\\) is the length of the contour line (intersection of the equipotential head surface with the ground surface) crossed by flow exiting the cell, and height \\(h\\cos\\theta\\) measured normal to the direction of water flow. The Darcy velocity of flow through the flow tube is given by \\(K\\sin\\theta,\\) where \\(K\\) is saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil, assumed spatially uniform. So discharge \\(q\\) out of the soil column is \\(q = b(h\\cos\\theta)K\\sin\\theta\\). For steady-state rainfall of intensity \\(I,\\) in depth per unit time, discharge out of the soil column is \\(IA,\\) where \\(A\\) is the contributing area (measured horizontally) for subsurface flow from infiltrating rainfall to the soil column. From this, we can define the vertical depth of saturation as\n\\[h = \\frac{IA}{bK\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta}.\n\\]\nThe force tending to move soil downslope is given by the portion of the soil-column weight directed parallel to the base of the soil layer \\(\\gamma_s (z \\cos\\theta) \\sin\\theta\\). So the factor of safety (FoS) for the soil layer is defined as\n\\[\nFoS = \\frac{(\\gamma_sz\\cos^2\\theta - \\frac{IA\\gamma_w\\cos^2\\theta)}{Kb\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta})\\tan\\phi}{\\gamma_sz\\sin \\theta \\cos\\theta} = \\frac{(\\gamma_sz - \\frac{IA\\gamma_w)}{Kb\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta})\\tan\\phi}{\\gamma_sz\\tan\\theta}\n\\]\nIf we hold soil properties \\(\\gamma_s, \\gamma_w, z, \\phi\\), and \\(K\\) constant, and assume steady state rainfall intensity \\(I\\), then FoS is a function solely of topographic attributes \\(b\\) and \\(\\theta\\) and of the contributing area \\(A\\). We measure \\(b\\) and \\(\\theta\\) from the DEM. Contributing area is estimated as a function of storm duration, assuming a spatially constant saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nThe use of a steady-state condition and infinite slope to derive these equations is not realistic. Clearly, slopes are not planar and infinite, soil is not uniform, and rainfall is not steady state. More realistic models can be derived (Iverson 2000), though with more parameters the values of which must be inferred. However, the infinite slope model has been employed successfully as an indicator of potential instability Dietrich, Bellugi, and Asua (2001) and, as used here, it provides a single-valued measure of potential topographic influences on slope stability via values of \\(b, \\theta\\,\\) and \\(A\\). This is confounded by correlations of soil properties with topography. We may be able to counter this to some extent by including mapped soil types in the model. We may also experiment with topographically based models of soil depth.\nBehavior of this equation over a range of slope gradients for different values of soil properties, contributing areas, and rainfall intensities.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(data.table)\n\ngamma_s &lt;- 1.8 # unit weight of soil normalized by unit weight of water\nz &lt;- 1.0 # soil layer depth measured vertically\ntanPhi &lt;- 0.7\nK &lt;- 1.0\nb &lt;- 1.0\ntantheta &lt;- seq(from=0.4,to=1.5,length.out=100)\ntheta &lt;- atan(tantheta)\ncostheta &lt;- cos(theta)\nsintheta &lt;- sin(theta)\n\nI &lt;- 0.01\nA &lt;- 5.\nu &lt;- I*A/(K*b*sintheta*costheta)\nFoS1 &lt;- (gamma_s*z - u)*tanPhi/(gamma_s*z*tantheta)\n\nI &lt;- 0.01\nA &lt;- 15.\nu &lt;- I*A/(K*b*sintheta*costheta)\nFoS2 &lt;- (gamma_s*z - u)*tanPhi/(gamma_s*z*tantheta)\n\nFoSdata &lt;- data.table(tantheta,FoS1,FoS2)\nlong &lt;- melt(FoSdata, id='tantheta')\nthisplot &lt;- ggplot(long, aes(x=tantheta, y=value)) + \n  geom_line(aes(colour=variable)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Tan(theta)\",\n    y = \"FoS\",\n    colour = \"Contributing Area (sq m)\",\n    title = \"Change of FoS with surface gradient\",\n    subtitle = \"z=1.0, tan(phi)=0.7, K=1.0, b=1.0, I=0.01\",\n    caption = \"Increasing slope or contributing area reduces FoS\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"inside\", legend.position.inside = c(0.6, 0.8)) +\n  scale_color_discrete(labels = c(\"A=5.\", \"A=15.\"))\nplot(thisplot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan: Run partialAccum for a range of storm durations, set hopefully reasonable values for the variables to be held constant, and code up an FoS routine.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(terra)\n# Get the FoS raster created with program PartialAccum for a 5-hour-duration storm.\nFoS_pca5 &lt;- terra::rast(\"c:/work/data/wrangell/fos_pca5.flt\")\nf &lt;- as.data.table(FoS_pca5) \n# Get the FoS values at the inventoried initiation points\npnts &lt;- terra::vect(\"c:/work/data/wrangell/LS_pnts.shp\")\nls &lt;- terra::extract(FoS_pca5,pnts)\n# Filter the raster FoS values to include only those less than the maximum \n# point value.\nmaxls &lt;- max(ls$fos_pca5)\nfsub &lt;- subset(f, fos_pca5 &lt;= maxls)\nf1 &lt;- as.data.table(fsub)\n\n\n\n\nCode\np1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_density(data=f1, aes(x=fos_pca5, fill = 'DEM'), alpha=0.5) +\n  geom_density(data=ls, aes(x=fos_pca5, fill = 'Landslides'), alpha=0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"\", values = c(DEM = 'blue', Landslides = 'red')) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Factor of Safety\",\n    y = \"Density\",\n    title = \"Wrangell\",\n    subtitle = \"Storm duration = 5hr\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"inside\", legend.position.inside = c(0.6, 0.8))\n  \np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDietrich, W.

    "text": "How can we effectively characterize the potential for landslide initiation? A landslide inventory shows where landslides have occurred over some period of time. We use the inventory to identify conditions spatially and temporally associated with landslide occurrence. We assume that the landslides in the inventory represent some proportion of the population of all possible landslides and expect that landslides in the future will be associated with similar conditions. We can characterize these associations in terms of density: the number (or area or volume) of observed landslides per unit basin area. We seek to determine landslide density as a function of measurable attributes of the terrain and weather associated with the landslides observed. In most cases, we focus on the terrain because we do not have reliable methods for measuring attributes of the weather associated with landslide occurrence.\nOnce we have functions describing landslide density in terms of terrain attributes, we can create maps of landslide density based on those attributes. If done well, we should find that most of the observed landslide initiation zones fall within areas of high modeled landslide density, but perhaps not all the initiation zones, because some proportion of the landslides may have occurred in unusual locations. A low modeled density indicates conditions associated with a smaller proportion of the observed landslides. Likewise, we will have zones of high modeled landslide density where there are no observed landslides in our inventory. We expect that the inventory represents only a portion of the entire population of all possible landslides. Areas of high modeled density indicate those zones with conditions similar to the conditions where landslides were observed. We expect that these will be sites of landslide occurrence in the future.\nWithin the boundaries of the basin or study-area where the landslide inventory was collected, if we integrate the modeled density over that area, the integral will give the number (or area or volume, depending on how the landslide initiation zones where characterized) of landslides within that boundary. The number (area, volume) of inventoried landslides, however, depends on the time period over which the inventory was collected and the landslide-triggering storms that occurred during that period. Density can, therefore, only provide a relative measure of how landslide potential varies over the landscape, showing where conditions associated with a greater or lesser proportion of the landslides in the inventory exist.\nTo provide an absolute measure of landslide potential, we can translate the density of landslides to the proportion of landslides. Then our maps go from indicating the number (or area or volume) of landslides in the inventory associated with particular terrain attributes to the proportion of landslides in the inventory associated with those attributes. This provides a testable prediction. For any future landslide inventory, we can predict what proportion of observed landslides will occur within any particular portion of a basin or study area. We can then, for example, delineate those locations from which we expect a certain proportion (e.g., 20%) of all landslides will occur, ranked by landslide density.\nThe goal here is to find functions relating landslide density to terrain attributes. The frequency-ratio method measures density directly. To measure the frequency ratio, construct two cumulative frequency distributions for a single attribute, such as hillslope gradient, one distribution for areas within the initiation zones and another for the entire study area. Then divide the distribution for the initiation zones by the distribution for the entire area. For any increment of hillslope gradient, this ratio gives the proportion of area in the initiation zones; that is, the density as a function of gradient. One can generalize to more than one attribute, but characterizing the frequency distribution of multiple attributes becomes exceeding uncertain and sensitive to any peculiarities in our sample of landslides: we encounter the curse of dimensionality\nFrequency ratio is appealing because it uses all the information we can infer about topography from a DEM and is easily interpreted. But we also want to explore relationships with multiple terrain attributes. There are many classification modeling strategies available: logistic regression, random forest, etc., but these require that we extract a sample of points from both the initiation zones and the rest of the study area. The attributes associated with those points are then used to characterize conditions associated with the initiation zones. This characterization is provided as a probability that any location is within an initiation zone. Probability in this case can be interpreted as density. For example, if we randomly sample 100 points from the study area with a modeled probability of 0.7, we expect that 70 will fall inside initiation zones and 30 outside. Density is simply a measure of proportion: 70 points out of 100 gives a density of 0.7. There is uncertainty in what the measured proportion will be, but we can calculate that uncertainty as a function of the probability and the number of points sampled.",

    "text": "Independence\nHow far apart do the sample points need to be to ensure that each provides a measure of terrain attributes independent of the values at any other point? We can look at the degree of autocorrelation for topographic attributes using, e.g., a semivariogram, as we do below, but what does that actually tell us?\nConsider a long, planar slope. The elevation changes in a regular fashion along the fall line, but not at all along a contour. The gradient (measured along the fall line) is about the same everywhere on the slope, so the degree of correlation is high. The gradient will decrease at the ridge crest and the base of the slope, so the range on the semivariogram should be about the length of the hillslope. Yet, we may find multiple, separate landslides initiating within lesser distances of each other on the slope. What terrain attributes might be affecting landslide initiation? If we exclude the ridge and base of the slope from calculation of the semivariance, we may find a smaller range (and sill) indicative of minor variations in gradient along the slope. Is this the appropriate separation distance to use?\nGiven our reliance on remotely sensed data, we cannot fully assess the factors that influence landslide initiation and it is probable that some of these factors are not visible with the data we have. These invisible-to-use factors may vary over length scales less than the variations visible in our remotely sensed data, even with high-resolution lidar-derived topography. The size distribution of the landslide scars themselves may offer some insight. Here are boxplots and cumulative frequency distributions of the estimated width of the initiation zones of the 244 landslide polygons used from the Tongass National Forest landslide inventory on Wrangell Island. Width is estimated both as the square root of the initiation-zone surface area and from the average width of the entire landslide polygon.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(TerrainWorksUtils)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# First we need to run LS_poly to build the data files used as inputs for the analyses.\n\ndataFolder &lt;- \"c:/work/data/wrangell/\"\nDEM &lt;- paste0(dataFolder, \"elev_wrangell.flt\")\npolyFile &lt;- paste0(dataFolder, \"LS_polys_workingcopy.shp\")\npolyID &lt;- \"ID\"\n\ngradRadius &lt;- 7.5\ndiameter &lt;- round(2.*gradRadius,0)\ngradFile &lt;- paste0(dataFolder, \"Grad_\", diameter, \".flt\")\nif (file.exists(paste0(gradFile))) {\n  inGrad &lt;- gradFile\n  outGrad &lt;- \"nofile\"\n} else {\n  inGrad &lt;- \"nofile\"\n  outGrad &lt;- gradFile\n}\n\ntanRadius &lt;- 15.0\ndiameter &lt;- round(2.*tanRadius,0)\ntanFile &lt;- paste0(dataFolder, \"Tan_\", diameter, \".flt\")\nif (file.exists(tanFile)) {\n  inTan &lt;- tanFile\n  outTan &lt;- \"nofile\"\n} else {\n  inTan &lt;- \"nofile\"\n  outTan &lt;- tanFile\n}\n\nprofRadius &lt;- 15.0\ndiameter &lt;- round(2.*profRadius,0)\nprofFile &lt;- paste0(dataFolder, \"Prof_\", diameter, \".flt\")\nif (file.exists(profFile)) {\n  inProf &lt;- profFile\n  outProf &lt;- \"nofile\"\n} else {\n  inProf &lt;- \"nofile\"\n  outProf &lt;- profFile\n}\n\ninFoS &lt;- paste0(dataFolder, \"FoS_pca72.flt\")\noutNodes &lt;- paste0(dataFolder, \"centerNodes\")\noutCSV &lt;- paste0(dataFolder, \"outpoly\")\noutInit &lt;- paste0(dataFolder, \"init\")\nscratchDir &lt;- \"c:/work/scratch/\"\nexecutableDir &lt;- \"c:/work/sandbox/landslideutilities/projects/ls_poly/x64/release\"\n  \nif (!file.exists(paste0(dataFolder, outCSV, \"_init.csv\"))) {\n  returnCode &lt;- TerrainWorksUtils::LS_poly(\n    DEM,\n    polyFile,\n    polyID,\n    inGrad,\n    inTan,\n    inProf,\n    inFoS,\n    outGrad,\n    gradRadius,\n    outTan,\n    tanRadius,\n    outProf,\n    profRadius,\n    outNodes,\n    outCSV,\n    outInit,\n    scratchDir,\n    executableDir)\n\n  if (returnCode != 0) { \n    stop(\"Error in LS_poly, return code: \", returnCode)\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\ninitStats &lt;- as.data.table(read.csv(paste0(outCSV, \"_init.csv\")))\n\nboxarea &lt;- ggplot(initStats, aes(y=sqrt(Area_m2))) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Sqrt(Area)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())\n\ncumarea &lt;- ggplot(initStats, aes(x=sqrt(Area_m2))) + \n  stat_ecdf(geom=\"step\") +\n  labs(x = \"Sqrt(Area)\",\n       y = \"Proportion of Initiation Zones\")\n\nboxwidth &lt;- ggplot(initStats, aes(y=Width_m)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Width (m)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())\n\ncumwidth &lt;- ggplot(initStats, aes(x=Width_m)) + \n  stat_ecdf(geom=\"step\") +\n  labs(x = \"Width (m)\",\n       y = \"Proportion of Initiation Zones\")\n\npwidth &lt;- (boxarea + cumarea) / (boxwidth + cumwidth)\npwidth &lt;- pwidth + plot_annotation(\n  title = \"Estimated Width of Initiation Zones\" ,\n  caption = \"Width (m) is estimated as the square root of the initiation-zone area, shown in the upper panels, and the average width of the entire landslide polygon, shown in the lower panels\")\npwidth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth measures suggest that about 90% of all initiation zones are 50 m or less in width. Let’s look at some potential predictors. Program samplePoints will read the specified rasters of predictors, find the range of predictor values that fall within the initiation-zone polygons, and create a mask file to exclude areas outside those ranges. This is similar to excluding the ridge top and valley floor with looking at gradient values in the planar-slope example described above. We are examining only those areas with the range of predictor values where landslide initiations were observed. The code chunks below will run samplePoints to create a mask raster and then use the cv_spatial_autocor function from the blockCV package to calculate semivariograms for each predictor raster. The semivariogram will indicate the range of spatial autocorrelation for each predictor.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(terra, exclude = \"resample\")\n\n# List of predictor rasters, single precision real\nr1 &lt;- c(\"Gradient\", \"c:/work/data/wrangell/grad_15\", 0.01, 0.99)\nr2 &lt;- c(\"FoS_5\", \"c:/work/data/wrangell/FoS_pca5\", 0., 0.99)\nr3 &lt;- c(\"FoS_72\", \"c:/work/data/wrangell/FoS_pca72\", 0., 0.99)\nr4 &lt;- c(\"PCA_5\", \"c:/work/data/wrangell/pca_5\", 0., 0.99)\nr5 &lt;- c(\"PCA_72\", \"c:/work/data/wrangell/pca_72\", 0., 0.99)\nR4rasters &lt;- list(r1,r2,r3,r4,r5)\n\nfor (i in 1:length(R4rasters)) {\n  r &lt;- terra::rast(paste0(R4rasters[[i]][2],\".flt\"))\n  names(r) &lt;- R4rasters[[i]][1]\n  if (i == 1) {\n    rstack &lt;- r\n  } else {\n    rstack &lt;- c(rstack, r)\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Run sample points to build a raster masking zones outside the range of predictor values\n# associated with landslide initiation zones.

The range of the semivariogram for this measure of gradient is about 300 meters, which is around the midpoint of hillslope lengths included within the mask raster. The two flow accumulation rasters, PCA_5 and PCA_72, indicate the approximate contributing area for each DEM cell for a 5 and 72 hour storm, assuming a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1 m/sec and ignoring infiltration time. PCA_5 is highly correlated with gradient and has a similar semivariogram range. PCA_72 has flow concentrations within channels and exhibits much larger variability than PCA_5, indicated by its larger range and sill. The factor of safety values (FoS) are derived from the gradient and flow accumulation values. Despite the large differences between PCA_5 and PCA_72, the FoS rasters based on these exhibit similar patterns of variability with nearly equal ranges and sills.\nWhat do these range values imply for our strategy of sampling independent points? They are all several times larger than the typical scale of a landslide initiation zone. Even if we use the ~300-m range found for gradient as the minimum point spacing, that precludes more than one sample point per landslide initiation zone. Ultimately the goal is to have a representative sample that accurately reflects the range and frequency distribution of predictor values across both the observed initiation zones and the masked area spanning the range of values observed within the initiation zones. Independence precludes bias in our representation of those frequency distributions, but bias will still be an issue if we have too few points.",

That depends on how uniform the frequency distributions are. Long-tailed distributions require more points to ensure that rare conditions get samples. We can compare frequency distributions of sample-point sets to those of the predictor rasters. This is straight forward for single predictors, but becomes more complicated when looking at combinations of predictors.\nRepresentative sample, curse of dimensionality.\n\nSingle predictors\nLet’s start with one sample point per initiation zone and a point spacing of 300m elsewhere.

We can use these to compare the frequency distributions of the sample points to those of the predictor rasters. The files have five columns:\n\nLower, the lower bound of the interval\nUpper, the upper bound of the interval\nMid, the midpoint of the interval\nNumber, the number of DEM cells or sample points included in the interval\nCumulativeProp, the cumulative proportion of cells or samples\n\nThere are two things of interest, examined in the follows plots:\n\nHow different, or similar, are the frequency distributions for areas inside and outside of the initiation zones?\nHow well do the frequency distributions for the sample points match those of the area sampled?\n\n\n\nCode\npcum_in &lt;-

total-area distributions, particularly for the initiation zones. In these examples, the initiation zones have one third as many points as the total analysis area, but they also cover only 1/1000th of the total analysis area, so the number of points per unit area in the initiation zones is about 300 times higher.\nComing:\n\nSampling over a multidimensional data space.\nMachine-learning workflow for initiation probability.",
